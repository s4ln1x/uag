# UAG repository

This repository contains the last projects of my masters degree on the
Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara (UAG).

Since the classes are provided in Spanish some material is just in Spanish, I
do not have the intention to translate that to English.

The classes covered are:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Distributed Systems
- Statistics and Probability
- Thesis

If you want to learn, propose, reuse or know something related to this
repository please do not hesitate on open an issue and I will be glad to help.
